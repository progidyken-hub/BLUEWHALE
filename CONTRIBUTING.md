## How Can I Contribute?

### Adding Spec Vectors
The most impactful way to contribute is by adding new test vectors to `spec/vectors.json`. If you find an edge case or a tricky address format, follow these steps:
1. Add the case to `spec/vectors.json`.
2. Run `node spec/validate.js` to ensure it meets the schema.
3. Update the TypeScript, Go, and Dart implementations to pass the new vector.

### Reporting Bugs
- Check the [Issues](https://github.com/REDISHFISH/BLUEWHALE/issues) to see if the bug has already been reported.
- If not, open a new issue with a clear title and description, including steps to reproduce the bug.

### Suggesting Enhancements
- Open an issue to discuss your idea.
- Clearly explain why this enhancement would be useful to others.

### Pull Requests
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes (`pnpm test`, `go test ./...`, `dart test`).
5. Follow the [Commit Message Convention](#commit-message-convention).
6. Run `pnpm changeset` to document your changes before opening a PR.

## Development Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run the spec validator
node spec/validate.js

# Run tests across all packages
pnpm test                                  # TypeScript
cd packages/core-go && go test ./...       # Go
cd packages/core-dart && dart test         # Dart
```

---

## Commit Message Convention

All commits and **pull request titles** must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

### Format

```
<type>(optional-scope): <short description>
```

The `type` must be one of:

| Type       | When to use                                              |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `feat`     | A new feature                                            |
| `fix`      | A bug fix                                                |
| `docs`     | Documentation-only changes                               |
| `style`    | Formatting, whitespace — no logic change                 |
| `refactor` | Code change that is neither a fix nor a feature          |
| `perf`     | Performance improvement                                  |
| `test`     | Adding or updating tests                                 |
| `build`    | Build system or external dependency changes              |
| `ci`       | CI/CD configuration changes                              |
| `chore`    | Maintenance tasks (bumping versions, updating lockfiles) |

### Examples

```
feat(core-ts): add M-address round-trip validation
fix(core-go): handle overflow in 64-bit routing ID
docs: update quickstart guide
ci: add Codecov upload to ci-ts workflow
chore: bump pnpm to v9
```

> **PR titles are linted automatically** via the `Lint PR Title` GitHub Actions workflow. A PR with a non-conforming title will fail the check and must be corrected before merging.

## Changeset Workflow

This project uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage versioning and changelogs. Every PR that changes user-facing behaviour (features, fixes, or breaking changes) **must include a changeset**.

### Creating a changeset

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

The interactive prompt will ask:
1. **Which packages** are affected (`@redishfish/bluewhale-core`, `core-go`, `core-dart`, …).
2. **Bump type** — `patch` for bug fixes, `minor` for new features, `major` for breaking changes.
3. **Summary** — a one-line description that will appear in the changelog.

A new file is added under `.changeset/`. Commit it along with your code changes.

### What happens on merge to `main`

The `Release` GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) runs on every push to `main`:

- If unreleased changesets exist, it opens (or updates) a **"Version Packages"** PR that bumps all affected package versions and updates their `CHANGELOG.md` files.
- When that PR is merged, the workflow **publishes** the new versions to the npm registry and creates **GitHub Releases** with the generated changelogs.

### When you don't need a changeset

Skip `pnpm changeset` for changes that don't affect published packages:
- CI/CD workflow changes
- Documentation-only changes
- Internal tooling / scripts
- Test-only changes

## Deprecation and Versioning

When changing or removing a feature, warning code, or error code, follow the [multi-language deprecation policy](docs/spec/deprecation-policy.mdx). Deprecations must land in the TypeScript, Go, and Dart SDKs together.

---

## Style Guide

- **TypeScript**: Follow the existing Prettier/ESLint config.
- **Go**: Run `go fmt` before committing.
- **Dart**: Run `dart format` before committing.
